## General steps:
## Assume study is GSEXXX
## sudo pip install cwlref-runner
## sudo pip install cwltool
## curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_11.x | sudo -E bash -
## sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
## 1. Create GSEXXX; GSEXXX/pre-processed, GSEXXX/deconvolution_results, and GSEXXX/raw
## 2. Create a create_processed_tables.R file; upload_id here should point to GSEXXX/pre-processed;
##    gt_upload_id should point to GSEXXX; source create_processed_tables.R
## 3. Create a deconvolve.R file by copying over from GSE64385/deconvolve.R
##    update expr_id, upload_id, and github.path
##    expr_id should point to a log normal expression file
##    upload_id should point to GSEXXX/deconvolution_results
##    source deconvolve.R
## 4. Create a qc_markdown_config.yaml file.  Copy from GSE64385/qc_markdown_config.yaml.
##    Edit cibersort_results and mcpcounter_results (these will be in GSEXXX/deconvolution_results)
##    Edit log_tpm_expression (this will have been placed in upload_id = GSEXXX/pre-processed by create_processed_tables.R)
##    Edit ground_truth (this will have been placed in upload_id = GSEXXX/pre-processed by create_processed_tables.R)
##    Edit annotations (this will have been placed in upload_id = GSEXXX/pre-processed by create_processed_tables.R)
##    Edit cibersort_common_groups (describing the populations that will be compared between CIBERSORT and ground truth)
##    Edit gt_cs_groups [defining new population (new_col) as sum of columns (old_cols) in ground truth.
##                       Every column in cibersort_common_groups should either already exist in ground truth (by the same name)
##                       or be defined here.]
##    Edit cs_gt_groups [defining new population (new_col) as sum of columns (old_cols) in CIBERSORT output.
##                       Every column in cibersort_common_groups should either already exist in the CIBERSORT output (by the same name)
##                       or be defined here.]
##    Edit mcpcounter_common_groups (describing the populations that will be compared between MCP-counter and ground truth)
##    Edit gt_mcp_groups [defining new population (new_col) as sum of columns (old_cols) in ground truth.
##                       Every column in mcpcounter_common_groups should either already exist in ground truth (by the same name)
##                       or be defined here.]
##    Edit cs_mcp_groups [defining new population (new_col) as sum of columns (old_cols) in MCP-counter output.
##                       Every column in mcpcounter_common_groups should either already exist in the CIBERSORT output (by the same name)
##                       or be defined here.]
## 5. Copy qc_markdown.Rmd from GSE64385/qc_markdown.Rmd
## 6. Create qc_markdown_to_synapse.R by copying from GSE64385/qc_markdown_to_synapse.R and editing
##    owner to point to GSEXXX; source qc_markdown_to_synapse.R
