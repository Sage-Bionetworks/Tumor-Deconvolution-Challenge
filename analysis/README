## Assume study is GSEXXX
## 1. Create GSEXXX; GSEXXX/pre-processed, GSEXXX/deconvolution_results, and GSEXXX/raw
## 2. Create a setup.R file by copying over from GSE20300/setup.R
##    update dataset to GSEXXX
##    update linear_expr_id to point to a non-log/linear and normalized (e.g., cpm, tmp, FPKM) expression file
##           in GSEXXX/pre-processeda
##    update deconvolution_results_folder_upload_id to be GSEXXX/deconvolution_results
##    update preprocessed_folder_upload_id to be GSEXXX/pre-processed
##    update gt_upload_id to be GSEXXX
## 3. Create a create_processed_tables.R file by copying over from GSE20300/create_processed_tables.R
##    source create_processed_tables.R
## 4. Create a deconvolve.R file by copying over from GSE20300/deconvolve.R
##    source deconvolve.R
## 5. Create a qc_markdown_config.yaml file by copying from GSE20300/qc_markdown_config.yaml.
##    Edit cibersort_results to point to GSEXXX/deconvolution_results/cibersort_results.tsv (created by deconvolve.R)
##    Edit mcpcounter_results to point to GSEXXX/deconvolution_results/mcpcounter_results.tsv (created by deconvolve.R)
##    Edit ground_truth (this will have been placed in upload_id = GSEXXX/ by create_processed_tables.R)
##    Edit log_expression (this will have been placed in upload_id = GSEXXX/pre-processed by create_processed_tables.R)
##    Edit annotations (this will have been placed in upload_id = GSEXXX/pre-processed by create_processed_tables.R)
##    Set dont_normalize_ground_truth_to_one to TRUE if the subset of ground truth populations used should not be normalized to one.
##    Set sum_cibersort_results_to_one if the subset of cibersort populations used (directly or indirectly)
##        in cibersort_common_groups should be normalized to one.  e.g., if the ground truth has only a subset of
##        immune cells (say, neutrophils, eosinophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes) that are normalized to one,
##        then this should be set to true so that the subset of cibersort populations that map to these four
##        groundtruth populations also are normalized to one.
##    Edit cibersort_common_groups (describing the populations that will be compared between CIBERSORT and ground truth)
##    Edit gt_cs_groups [defining new population (new_col) as sum of columns (old_cols) in ground truth.
##                       Every column in cibersort_common_groups should either already exist in ground truth (by the same name)
##                       or be defined here.]
##    Edit cs_gt_groups [defining new population (new_col) as sum of columns (old_cols) in CIBERSORT output.
##                       Every column in cibersort_common_groups should either already exist in the CIBERSORT output (by the same name)
##                       or be defined here.]
##    Edit mcpcounter_common_groups (describing the populations that will be compared between MCP-counter and ground truth)
##    Edit gt_mcp_groups [defining new population (new_col) as sum of columns (old_cols) in ground truth.
##                       Every column in mcpcounter_common_groups should either already exist in ground truth (by the same name)
##                       or be defined here.]
##    Edit cs_mcp_groups [defining new population (new_col) as sum of columns (old_cols) in MCP-counter output.
##                       Every column in mcpcounter_common_groups should either already exist in the CIBERSORT output (by the same name)
##                       or be defined here.]
## 6. Copy qc_markdown.Rmd from GSE20300/qc_markdown.Rmd
## 7. Create qc_markdown_to_synapse.R by copying from GSE20300/qc_markdown_to_synapse.R.
##    update owner to point to GSEXXX
##    source qc_markdown_to_synapse.R
